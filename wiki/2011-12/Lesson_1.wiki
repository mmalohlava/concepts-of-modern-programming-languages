Your assignment is to define methods of the `MoneyCategory` class so that the code below passes:
  {{{
class Money {
    Integer amount
    String currency

    Money plus(Money other) {

    }

    public String toString() {
        "${amount} ${currency}"
    }
}

class MoneyCategory {
//TASK Define methods of the MoneyCategory class so that the code below passes
}

use(MoneyCategory) {
    println 10.eur
