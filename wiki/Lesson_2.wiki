  * Advanced dynamic meta-programing - builders
  * Static meta-programming
  * Domain Specific Languages
  * DSL-based frameworks - Grails, Griffon, Gradle

== Preparation ==

  * Checkout the recent state of our Project from [http://code.google.com/p/concepts-of-modern-programming-languages/source/checkout SVN]

== Homework ==

The assignment is to implement the "Unsupported" transformation which should make the annotated methods throw the {{{UnsupportedOperationException}}}.
{{{
class Calculator {
    def plus(a, b) {
        a + b
    }

    @Unsupported
    def minus(a, b) {}

    @Unsupported
    def divide(a, b) {}
}
}}}

Fill in the missing AST generation code to make the script pass. You can take inspiration from exercises.
